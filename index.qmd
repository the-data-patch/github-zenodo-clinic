Timing: 2 min  
Set expectations. This is about concepts first, mechanics second.  
Emphasize that this mirrors data publishing practices participants may already know.
1. Increase FAIR-ness
2. Make life easier for future you
3. Enable reuse and extension
4. Get credit for software as a research output

_fade. Links rot but snapshots save_

_your work from the void_

Science outlives tools and platforms.
Papers persist. Links rot.
Without snapshots, methods cannot be verified.

## <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/github/github-original-wordmark.svg" width="225" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> is not an archive

- _Excellent for collaboration_
- _No preservation guarantee_
- _Not designed for citation_
- _owned by private corporation (Microsoft)_

::: notes
Timing: 1 min  
Be explicit that this is not anti-GitHub.  
GitHub does its job very well. It just does not do this job.

## What is a code archive?

A code archive is:

- Persistent with PID
- Findable and citable
- Immutable once published
- Backed by long-term infrastructure

## Zenodo (for code)

- Generalist research repository
- Free and widely used
- Issues DOIs via DataCite
- Integrates with GitHub releases
- operated by CERN

::: notes
Timing: 1 min  
Do not go deep here. Zenodo is familiar enough.  
We are focusing on the GitHub integration.
CERN == European Organization for Nuclear Research, an intergovernmental organization funded by 23 member states

## GitHub + Zenodo model

- **GitHub**: active development
- **Zenodo**: frozen snapshots

**GitHub is where code lives  
Zenodo is where code is cited**

::: notes
Timing: 1 min

## Where will you use this?

- Instrument development  
- Pipeline development  
- Analysis iteration  

::: notes
Timing: 2 min  
Ask students to come up with examples
:::

## Versioning and DOIs

- Each GitHub release creates a new Zenodo version
- Each version gets its own DOI
- One concept DOI always points to the latest version

::: notes
Timing: 2 min  
This mirrors the Zenodo versioning explanation from the dataset clinic.  
:::

## Let's Practice

## Pre-work

* Make a GitHub account

::: notes
Timing: 3 min
Set clear expectations: this is a hands-on exercise.
Encourage participants to ask questions if stuck at any step.
Put a thumbs up in shared notes for each step when you're ready to move on
:::

---

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the example repo on GitHub
2. Click **Fork** (top right)
3. You now have your own copy under your account

::: notes
Timing: 2 min
Explain that forking allows them to experiment without affecting the original repo.
:::

---

## Step 2: Make a Change

* Edit the README
* Commit your changes with a meaningful message
* Push to your fork

::: notes
Timing: 3 min
Encourage small, safe changes to build confidence.
:::

---

## Step 3: Publish to Zenodo Sandbox

1. Log in to Zenodo sandbox
2. Activate the repository you forked
3. Create a GitHub release (tag your commit)
4. Zenodo generates a DOI for the release

::: notes
Timing: 5 min
Live demo, walk through it together.
:::

---

## Step 4: Make Additional Changes

* Update code or documentation
* Create a new release on GitHub
* Observe new DOI generated by Zenodo

::: notes
Timing: 3 min
Highlight that each release gets a unique DOI but all point back to the concept DOI.
This one they do on their own.
:::

---

## Step 5: Explore Examples

Look at successful uses of this mechanism:

* [Zenodo record 18087438](https://zenodo.org/records/18087438)
* [Zenodo record 5708827](https://zenodo.org/records/5708827)
* [Zenodo record 5708345](https://zenodo.org/records/5708345)

Note to Steve - add screenshots of examples and reference at the beginning too. Maybe find examples of instruments, pipelines and analysis. Parallel slide 'where wil you use this?'

::: notes
Timing: 3 min
Point out how each release has its own DOI, while the concept DOI points to all versions.
:::

---

## Step 6: Reflection

* Could you explain this to a collaborator?

::: notes
Timing: 5 min
Encourage participants to share experiences and ask clarifying questions. You will be asked to suggest and/or participate in mechanisms like this as a professional.
